						<!-- Week 1 -->
							<article id="wk1">
								<h2 class="major">Basics of Python</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/week 1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p> In Week 1, I learned the basics of Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Python was easy to understand and helped me start coding comfortably. 
									NumPy showed me how to work with numbers using arrays, which makes math faster. Matplotlib helped me turn data into graphs so I can see patterns clearly. 
									I practiced making line graphs, bar charts, and scatter plots, which gave me a solid start in understanding and visualizing data.</p>

						<!-- Week 2 -->
							<article id="wk2">
								<h2 class="major">Exoplanet detection method</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Week 2.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In Week 2, I learned how exoplanets are detected using the transit method and the radial velocity method. I explored how transit depth and flux help show when a planet passes in front of a star, 
									and how a star's tiny wobble reveals planets through radial velocity.
                                         I also learned to read the graphs that come from these methods. We discussed PANOPTES and how it helps capture real transit data, how we use it in our own observatory</p>
                                </article>

						<!-- Week 3 -->
							<article id="wk3">
								<h2 class="major">Light curve analysis</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/week 3.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In Week 3, I learned how to detect exoplanets using real data from NASA's TESS satellite. TESS finds planets by looking for small, repeated dips in a star's brightness, and we used the lightkurve Python library to analyze those light curves ourselves. 
                                        I practiced downloading data for a specific star wich is WASP-12, cleaning and flattening the light curve, finding the planet's orbital period, and folding the data to make the transit signal clear. Working with real TESS data helped me understand how astronomers confirm the presence of planets beyond our solar system.</p>
                                </article>
<!-- Week 4 -->
							<article id="wk4">
								<h2 class="major">Git/GitHub</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/week 4.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In Week 4, I learned about Git and GitHub. We started with a brief look at operating systems and user interfaces, then focused on why Git is useful for tracking changes in code. I practiced basic Git commands, created my own repository, and cloned it to my computer. This gave me hands-on experience in managing and sharing code effectively..</p>
                                </article>
<!-- Week 5 -->
							<article id="wk5">
								<h2 class="major">CV building in Overleaf
									 </h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/week 5.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In the 5th week, I learned about the power of LaTeX and Overleaf, 
									recognizing them as easy and indispensable tools for professional document preparation. It was clear that using simple commands allows for consistently high-quality, typeset output, which greatly benefits teachers and professionals by letting them focus on content rather than complex formatting.</p>
                                </article>
<!-- Week 5.5 -->
						    <article id="wk5">
								<h2 class="major">Website Creation</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/week 5 website.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In the 5th week, I also learned about the website creation: the roles of front-end and back-end. We covered the foundational technologies—HTML (structure), CSS (style), and JavaScript (interactivity)—and saw how using HTML5 templates can significantly simplify and speed up the initial development process</p>

								<article id="wk6">
								<h2 class="major">About Me
									 </h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Nzt.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Hello! I’m Nima Zangmo Tamang, currently studying in the 9th grade. A Low-key existential. I’m pretty introverted, but that’s honestly my
									 superpower, it lets me observe the world in my own calm way. Listening to music and singing are my go-to therapy. I’m also someone who finds 
									 comfort in nature. Whether it’s watching the sky shift colours or spending a night stargazing, I feel better when I’m exploring the world’s little sceneries.</p>
